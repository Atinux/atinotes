## Deployment on Cloudflare Pages

Once you created your GitHub repository with this template, you can connect to it, then add those env variables:

```
PASSWORD=<your-password>
NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD=<a-32-characters-long-password>
```

Then, setup the build command on CloudFlare Pages to be:

```bash
nuxt build
```

The output directory is: `dist/`

Next, you need to link a KV namespace to the deployment, the binding should be named `KV`.

That's all :sparkles:
